## Election-Audit Summary
This analysis gives detailed descriptions of county turnout rate, total votes counted in the election and breaks down the data further more by calculating the votes per candidate. With small tweaks to the code , we can analysis the data on a more granular level to determine the percentage rate of votes each candidate received by county. We can also use the same base for this code for a nationwide election by changing out counties for states.
